# Chan API Documentation Project

## About

We try to keep comprehensive and up-to-date documentation for various chan APIs. Typically they're lacking examples and are outdated, but we are here to change that.

## Supported APIs

Each API title has a link to our documentation on it (**TODO: do that**), and the badges will lead you to the site's original documentation.

* [4chan's API](apis/4chan/README.md) [![Normal priority](https://r3c0d3x.github.io/chan-apis/priority_shields/normal.svg)](https://github.com/4chan/4chan-api/)
  - While it does have some documentation, it's only for one object/structure. It lists multiple endpoints without going into detail about them, and doesn't seem to be updated very often.
* [vichan's API](apis/vichan/README.md) [![Normal priority](https://r3c0d3x.github.io/chan-apis/priority_shields/normal.svg)](https://github.com/vichan-devel/vichan-API/)
  - This has all the pitfalls of 4chan's API documentation because it's literally just a slightly modified fork of theirs.
* [420chan's API](apis/420chan/README.md) [![Low priority](https://r3c0d3x.github.io/chan-apis/priority_shields/low.svg)](http://api.420chan.org/)
  - Their documentation is detailed and lists example responses for each of their endpoints. It is good enough at the moment, but we should still have some documentation here for it in the future.
